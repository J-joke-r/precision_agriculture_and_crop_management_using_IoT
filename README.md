üå± Precision Agriculture and Crop Management using IoT and AI
This capstone project focuses on smart irrigation and crop management by integrating IoT sensors, cloud computing, and AI-driven recommendations. The goal is to optimize water usage, increase yield efficiency, and assist farmers with irrigation scheduling and crop rotation planning.
üöÄ Key Features
  ‚Ä¢	IoT-based Data Collection
      o	Soil Moisture (YL-69), Temperature & Humidity (DHT22), Water Flow (YFS-201), and Rainfall sensors.
      o	Real-time field data collected via ESP32 microcontroller.
  ‚Ä¢	Smart Irrigation Algorithm
      o	Automates irrigation using soil moisture, weather API, and rainfall data.
      o	Everyday irrigation cycle for paddy fields + optimized scheduling for other crops.
      o	Motor pumps controlled automatically through cloud-connected logic.
      ‚Ä¢	Crop Rotation Prediction (AI Integration)
      o	Uses Prophet model with 3‚Äì4 years of historical data.
      o	Suggests which crop yields maximum output with minimum water usage.
      o	Helps farmers decide the best crop to plant at a given time.
  ‚Ä¢	Cloud & App Integration
      o	Data uploaded to ThingSpeak and stored as CSV.
      o	Analysis results pushed back to Blynk IoT mobile app for farmer-friendly interface.
      o	Web + mobile dashboards for real-time monitoring.
