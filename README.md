## 🚀 Key Features  
1. **IoT-based Data Collection**  
   - Soil Moisture (YL-69), Temperature & Humidity (DHT22), Water Flow (YFS-201), and Rainfall sensors.  
   - Real-time field data collected via **ESP32 microcontroller**.  

2. **Smart Irrigation Algorithm**  
   - Automates irrigation using soil moisture, weather API, and rainfall data.  
   - Everyday irrigation cycle for **paddy fields** + optimized scheduling for other crops.  
   - Motor pumps controlled automatically through cloud-connected logic.  

3. **Crop Rotation Prediction (AI Integration)**  
   - Uses **Prophet model** with 3–4 years of historical data.  
   - Suggests which crop yields maximum output with minimum water usage.  
   - Helps farmers decide the best crop to plant at a given time.  

4. **Cloud & App Integration**  
   - Data uploaded to **ThingSpeak** and stored as CSV.  
   - Analysis results pushed back to **Blynk IoT mobile app** for farmer-friendly interface.  
   - Web + mobile dashboards for real-time monitoring.
